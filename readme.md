# throwTracker

## Goal
* determine a throw occurred
  * track acceleration
  * track amount of time
  * track GPS coordinates
* Given we know GPS coordinates of Tee's:
  * We can know how many throws per basket.
  * Calculate distance based on each throws gps from previous gps

## Purpose

We'd like to know how good our shots are and based on gps data we should be able to do all of the
tracking off throws alone.

## Todo List:
* load demo app to watch
* create page to show max acceleration.
* get GPS of where the acceleration occurred.
